**Update**: As of [v1.67](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_67), the ‚Äúfile nesting‚Äù feature described bellow is considered ‚Äústable‚Äù. This is reflected in the post where it makes sense.

[VS Code v1.64](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_64) was released a few days ago and it‚Äôs once again packaged with nice new features and improvements. An exciting new feature is the [Side Panel\*](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_64#_new-side-panel) that can be opened opposite to the Primary Side Bar, i.e. the ‚Äúother side of the screen‚Äù, giving you the option to have more views open at once. That can be quite useful on bigger screens.

Another new feature that catched my interest was the **experimental** support for [file nesting](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_64#_explorer-file-nesting). This feature lets you visually ‚Äúnest‚Äù/group related files under a ‚Äúroot‚Äù file in the same directory. For example, say you have a `main.ts` file and next to it you have `main.js`, `main.d.ts` and `main.js.map`. After enabling the file nesting feature and configuring it, VS Code will visually group the `main.*` files under the `main.ts` file, as shown in the following screenshot:

You can now ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù the `main.ts` file and reduce the ‚Äúclutter‚Äù. Note that the files are still in the same directory, they are just visually ‚Äúnested‚Äù under `main.ts`.

### How to enable and configure file nesting

There are three new settings:

- `explorer.fileNesting.enabled` - Controls whether file nesting is enabled.
- `explorer.fileNesting.expand` - Controls whether file nests show as expanded by default.
- `explorer.fileNesting.patterns` - Controls how files get nested.

Note: The above description is taken from the release blog post.

After updating to VS Code v1.67, file nesting will not be enabled by default. Go ahead and do it by toggling the ‚ÄúFile Nesting: Enabled‚Äù setting. If you do it while you have a project open, you might notice that the files `package-lock.json` and `yarn.lock` files get nested under `package.json`. That is because VS Code has a default list of patterns that it uses to nest/group files. The `package.json` pattern is part of that list, as is the `main.ts` example described earlier. Can you find the patterns in the screenshot below?

### Creating your own patterns

Well, now you know how file nesting works. I think by using the examples provided in the Patterns list, you can come up your own patterns.

In the next section I‚Äôm going to show you some use cases where file nesting can come in handy.

### Use cases

#### Grouping config files by service, tool, type, etc.

Almost all front-end projects these days rely on a handful of config files to connect to a service, configure a framework or a tool. All those files end up in the root folder making it look like a mess. You can use file nesting to organize some of those file. An example could be grouping `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `.npmrc` and `.yarnrc` under `package.json`, Jest config files under `jest.config.js`, ESLint files under `.eslint`, etc. Check out [File Nesting Config for VS Code](https://github.com/antfu/vscode-file-nesting-config) repo for inspiration of possible groupings.

#### File nesting for Angular developers

When working with Angular components we often follow the [file structure convention](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#file-structure-conventions) where a component is represented by several similarly named files. For example, next to `button.component.ts`, we might also have `*.component.html|css|scss|spec` and `button.module.ts`. So for a single component we might end up with four or five different files in the same directory. Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to group most, if not all, of them under the main `*.component.ts` file and declutter the folder? Well, we can certainly do that now.

Open the file nesting settings and add a new pattern under the Patterns list. You can copy the following example and modify it to your preferences:

```js
// Item           // Value
"*.component.ts": "$(capture).component.html, $(capture).component.scss, $(capture).module.ts, $(capture).component.spec.ts"
```

VS Code will now visually nest any `*.component.html`, `*.component.scss`, `*.component.spec.ts` and `*.module.ts` files under `*.component.ts`, as seen bellow:

I hope you learned a nice little tip. üéâ
