Just recorded a short video where I show you how to use a component wrapped in an `NgModule` inside a component marked as standalone.

This approach allows you to continue using `NgModule`s in your app together with Standalone Components. This way you can slowly refactor any `NgModule`-based components to Standalone Components as you go.
