title: Using NgModule inside a Standalone Component
category: posts

Just recorded a short video where I show you how to use a component wrapped in an `NgModule` inside a component marked as standalone.

This approach allows you to continue using `NgModule`s in your app together with standalone components. This way you can slowly refactor any `NgModule`-based components to standalone components as you go.
