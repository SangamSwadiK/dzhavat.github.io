title: Using Standalone Components in an NgModule-based application

Earlier today I recorded a short video where I show you how to start using Standalone Components in an `NgModule`-based application.

This approach allows you to start using Standalone Components today! You don't have to go all in with Standalone Components. You can start by migrating a single route, or a single component. Then slowly work your way out through the rest of the application as you go.
