I’m really happy to share a new version of my [“CSS Flexbox Cheatsheet”](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dzhavat.css-flexbox-cheatsheet) VS Code extension! 🎉

The biggest change in this update is the addition of **interactive demos** to most properties. You will be able to see how each value works just by clicking on the buttons. I’ve wanted to add this for some time and pushing an initial iteration of it feels great.

Here’s how it works:

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/img/2020/09/09/interactive-demo.gif" alt="Interactive demos">
  <figcaption>Interactive demos in action</figcaption>
</figure>

Now I’m looking forward to your feedback! Tell me what you like about it and what you would like to see more. I’ll make sure to add it in a future update 🙂

Go [grab it](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dzhavat.css-flexbox-cheatsheet) while it’s hot 🔥
