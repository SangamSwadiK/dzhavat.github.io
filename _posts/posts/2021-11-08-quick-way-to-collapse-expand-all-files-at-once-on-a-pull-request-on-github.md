title: Quick way to collapse/expand all files at once on a pull request on GitHub
category: posts
---

When I review pull requests on GitHub I usually start by collapsing all files and then expand them one at a time in order to focus on a single thing.

This can be slightly annoying because GitHub by default shows all files in an expanded state and one needs to go through every single file header and click on the chevron icon to collapse all of them. Depending on the PR size this might take some time.

Luckily, thereâ€™s a quicker way. I recently found this neat shortcut/trick that can collapse/expand all files at once. Itâ€™s `Alt + click` on any icon in the fileâ€™s header. Hereâ€™s a video:

Now you know it too. Happy PR reviewing ðŸŽ‰
