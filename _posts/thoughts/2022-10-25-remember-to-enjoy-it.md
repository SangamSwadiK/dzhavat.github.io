It’s always been important to me to enjoy whatever I’m doing. Whether it’s work, a side project, writing on this blog, recording videos, going for a run or learning new stuff, simply enjoying it is the single most important factor that keeps me motivated.

I don’t recall exactly when but a few months ago an idea popped up in my head - I wanted to decorate the wall above my desk with the quote “Remember to enjoy it” as a little reminder that I must enjoy whatever I’m doing. And to make it extra special, I wanted to cut each letter out of wood.

So I got to work making small progress over time but enjoying it nonetheless (see 😉).

I found a nice font on the Internet and printed each letter in the desired size. I transferred the letters on a piece of wood and used a jigsaw to cut them. Then I used small wood files to smoothen the edges. Finally I applied a couple of coats of dark stain to make the letters darker.

And finally today I put the letters on the wall using double-sided tape. It’s beautiful. I like it a lot 🙂
