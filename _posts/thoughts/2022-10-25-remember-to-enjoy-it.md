It’s always been important to me to enjoy whatever I’m doing. Whether it’s work, a side project, writing on this blog, recording videos, going for a run or learning new stuff, simply enjoying it is the single most important factor that keeps me motivated.

I don’t recall exactly when but a few months ago an idea popped up in my head - I wanted to decorate the wall above my desk with the quote “Remember to enjoy it” as a little reminder that I must enjoy whatever I’m doing. And to make it extra special, I wanted to cut each letter out of wood.

So I got to work making small progress over time but enjoying it nonetheless (see 😉).

I found a nice font on the Internet and printed each letter in the desired size. I transferred the letters on a piece of wood and used a jigsaw to cut them. Then I used small wood files to smoothen the edges. Finally I applied a couple of coats of dark stain to make the letters darker.

And finally today I put the letters on the wall using double-sided tape. It’s beautiful. I like it a lot 🙂

I guess my line of thoughts is that I usually start something with enthusiasm and enjoyment. Then small things might begin to pile up along the way and shift the enjoyment to lack of motivation, feeling of being stuck or lack of interest. It’s in those moments where I should remember to stop for a moment, have a short break and go back to that feeling of enjoyment I had in the beginning.

We’re all busy with so many things in our daily life. A small reminder to enjoy the little things is needed once in a while.
