title: The morning is wiser than the evening

There’s a saying from where I come from that goes like “The morning is wiser than the evening”. I often contemplate about it and try to live by it in my own life.

What I get out of that saying is that making hasty decisions or acting upon an initial surge of negative emotion are often regrettable later on. I see actions triggered by negative emotions as problematic because they tend to have bigger consequences that we don’t really consider at the time.

What I try to do instead is give it some time, think about it, wait for the negative emotion to go away, wait until the morning. It can be challenging sometimes, especially when the decision needs to be made now or the emotions are high. But
But what I have found out ever time is that the morning gives me something which the evening can’t - I wake up “wiser”. With a fresh mind. Things have settled. My mind has had time to process the information. Then, more often than not, it’s easier to make a decision, or the action I was so eager to do is not really worth it anymore.

I believe that this “tool” has helped me avoid many unnecessary conflicts, has helped me in my decision making, and has helped me have a more peaceful life.
